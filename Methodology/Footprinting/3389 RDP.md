## Authenticate
```bash
xfreerdp /v:<ip> /u:'<domain\user>' /p:'<pass>' /port:3389 /dynamic-resolution 

# drive mapping
/data:<path>,<name_of_drive>
or
+drive:data,/path/to/dir

## RDWeb
If you gain access to an RDWeb portal, you may have access to various scripts that you can run.

In order to run the script, use xfreerdp and include the cpub.rdp file
```bash
xfreerdp <cpub_file>.rdp ...other_options...
```

See [[Breakouts]] for techniques on breaking out of RDS applications

## RDP Pass-the-Hash (PtH)
If you attempt to authenticate via RDP using a password hash, you may get the following error
```
Account restrictions are preventing this user from signing in. For example: blank passwords aren't allowed, sign-in times are limited, or a policy restriction has been enforced
```

To fix, just modify the reg key

Resolution
```cmd
reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f
```
