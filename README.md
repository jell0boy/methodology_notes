Here is a collection of some notes/templates I have gathered over the past year or so in preparation for the OSCP. Feel free to use as reference. Keep in mind developing your own methodology is crucial as it is how you begin to truly understand what is going on. Also note that my notes may be VERY spotty in sections.
